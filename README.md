I am currently working on various projects, both personal and professional, that aim to push the boundaries of technology and make a real impact in people's lives.
 
All of the repos utilizing API's are currently down since I can't afford to pay a monthly subscription consistently. Will fix it up eventually.

If you're interested in collaborating, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am always open to new opportunities and projects that challenge me to grow as a software developer.
