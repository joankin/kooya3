I am a seasoned software developer who is passionate about delivering `high-quality`, `efficient` and `user-friendly solutions`. With a long and rich experience in coding and software development, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the open-source community.

I am always open to new opportunities and projects that challenge me to grow as a software developer.

###### Fun fact: I am a big fan of video games and enjoy playing in my free time.
